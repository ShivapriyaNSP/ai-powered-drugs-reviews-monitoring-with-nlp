# ai-powered-drugs-reviews-monitoring-with-nlp
AI powered drugs reviews monitoring with NLP techniques. A project for beginners who are trying to understand various techniques in natural language processing . This project is specially made for stockholders from pharmaceutical manufacturing industry who benefit from monitoring their drug reviews from various social media to improve product quality.

This project analyzes pharmaceutical drug reviews to extract meaningful insights about medication effectiveness, side effects, and patient experiences. Using advanced NLP techniques and topic modeling, we uncover patterns in patient feedback that can help healthcare professionals, researchers, and patients make more informed decisions.
